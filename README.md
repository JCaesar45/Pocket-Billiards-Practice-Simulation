```# Pocket Billiards Practice Simulation

## Overview
This project is a simplified 2D Pocket Billiards (Pool) practice simulation inspired by the **Accu-Stats** theme. It allows players to aim and shoot the cue ball to practice shots and improve their skills in a realistic environment. The current implementation features basic physics, collision detection, and an intuitive aiming system.

## Features
- **Green felt-themed pool table** with realistic cushion and pocket visuals.
- **Cue ball and object ball** with basic collision physics.
- **Aiming system** with visual guide lines for precise shots.
- **Simple physics** including friction and elastic collisions.
- **Responsive design** optimized for desktop browsers.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 Canvas API for rendering the game graphics.
- Vanilla JavaScript for game logic and physics.
- CSS for styling inspired by the classic Accu-Stats pool hall theme.

## Setup Instructions
To run this simulation locally or on CodePen:

### In CodePen:
1. Create a new Pen.
2. Copy the code into the respective sections:
    - **HTML**: paste the HTML code.
    - **CSS**: paste the CSS code.
    - **JavaScript**: paste the JavaScript code.
3. Save and run the project.

### Locally:
1. Save the following files:
    - `index.html`
    - `style.css`
    - `script.js`
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Usage
- Click on the cue ball (white ball) to start aiming.
- Drag the mouse to set the shot direction and power.
- Release the mouse button to shoot the cue ball.
- Watch the balls collide and stop due to friction.
- Aim and shoot repeatedly to practice different shots.

## Future Improvements
- Transition to a 3D VR environment using frameworks like [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) or [Three.js](https://threejs.org/).
- Add multiple object balls with scoring.
- Implement more realistic physics and spin effects.
- Incorporate VR controls for an immersive experience.
- Create a full game with levels, tutorials, and practice modes.
